## Description
In 2003, in the article "David Lusseau et al., The bottelenosis dolphin community of Doubful Sound features a large proportion of long-lasting associations, Journal of Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 54:4, 396-405 (2003)." a social network of lasting relationships is identified in a community of 62 dolphins and presented as an (undirected) graph for studies. Data are in attached file (soc-dolphins.zip). The project consists of writing a program in which it reads the file (soc-dolphins.mtx, or txt), assembles with this data an undirected, weightless graph, using adjacency lists, and then performs the following:

(1) It implements two forms of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm: one with pivoting, the other without pivoting;

(2) Finds and prints on screen (twice, once for each Bron-Kerbosch implementation) all maximal clicks (indicating the number of vertices and which ones);

(3) The average agglomeration coefficient of the graph.
